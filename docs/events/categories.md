# Advanced Categories

The Advanced Categories feature is a powerful system for organizing and visualizing your events. It works by parsing a `Category` and optional `Sub-Category` from your event titles, unlocking features like fine-grained color-coding and the upcoming Timeline View.

This system is designed to work across **all calendar sources**, including remote calendars like Google Calendar and iCal feeds, making it a universal standard for your vault.

!!! success "Why You Should Use This" - **See Your Life at a Glance:** Assign unique colors to "Work," "Personal," "Fitness," etc., to instantly see how your time is allocated. - **Future-Proof Your Vault:** This system is the foundation for many upcoming features, including timeline views and advanced analytics. Adopting it now will ensure you get the most out of Full Calendar. - **Universal Compatibility:** A single, consistent organizational method for local and remote events.

## The Title Format

The plugin uses a specific format to identify categories and sub-categories in your event titles.

`Category - Sub-Category - Event Name`

The delimiter is a **dash surrounded by spaces (`-`)**.

- `✅ Correct: Work - Project Sync - Daily Standup`
- `✅ Correct: Personal - Run` (Sub-category is optional)
- `❌ Incorrect: Work-Project Sync` (Missing spaces around the dash)

When displayed on the calendar, the `Category` is stripped from the title to keep the view clean (e.g., you'll see `Project Sync - Daily Standup`). The full title is always preserved in the note.

Storage details:

- Daily Note calendars: The category and sub-category are part of the list item text (the title). Inline fields do not include a separate category key.
- Full Note calendars: The category and sub-category are encoded in the `title` field of frontmatter; separate `category`/`subCategory` keys are not persisted in frontmatter.

!!! tip "Why this format?"
This title-based approach was chosen for maximum compatibility. Most remote calendar systems (like Google Calendar) don't have a dedicated "category" field that syncs externally. By embedding the category in the title, you can organize events from _any_ source, and the plugin will recognize them.

## Enabling Advanced Categories

This feature can perform a one-time, permanent modification of your event notes. **It is highly recommended to back up your vault before enabling this feature.**

1.  Go to **Full Calendar Settings → Advanced categorization and Timeline**.
2.  Toggle **"Enable Advanced Categorization"** on.
3.  A warning modal will appear explaining the permanent changes. After proceeding, a second modal will ask how you want to bulk-categorize your existing local events:
    - **Use Parent Folder (Smart):** For any event that _doesn't_ already have a category, its parent folder's name will be used as the category. This is the safest and most common choice.
    - **Use Parent Folder (Forced):** The parent folder's name will be prepended to _all_ event titles, even if they already have one. Use with caution, as this can create nested categories (e.g., `NewCat - OldCat - Title`).
    - **Forced Default Update:** You provide a default category, and it will be prepended to _all_ event titles.

## Managing Category Colors

Once enabled, a new management section will appear in the settings.

- **Add a Category:** Start typing in the "Add a new category..." input box. It provides autocomplete suggestions for categories found in your vault that you haven't configured yet. Click **Add**.
- **Change Color:** Click the color swatch next to any category to open a color picker.
- **Delete a Setting:** Click **Delete** to remove a category's color setting. This _does not_ remove the category from your event titles.
- **Save:** After making changes, click **Save Category Settings**.

## Disabling & Cleaning Up

If you decide to turn this feature off, the plugin will help you clean up your notes.

1.  Toggle "Enable Advanced Categorization" off in settings.
2.  A warning modal will explain that this will remove known category prefixes from your event titles and file names. It will also **permanently delete your saved category color settings.**
3.  If you proceed, the plugin will process all your local calendars to remove the `Category - ` prefix, restoring them to their original state.
