# Internationalization (i18n) Guide for Full Calendar

Full Calendar supports multiple languages through a robust i18n system. This guide explains how to use, extend, and contribute translations for the plugin.

---

## How It Works

- The plugin uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization.
- Translation files are located in `src/features/i18n/locales/`.
- The UI language automatically matches your Obsidian language setting.
- All translation keys are type-safe and validated at compile time.

### Supported Languages

The following languages are currently supported:

- English (`en`)
- French (`fr`)
- German (`de`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- Italian (`it`)

---

## Adding a New Language

1. **Create a new translation file** in `src/features/i18n/locales/` (e.g., `fr.json` for French).
2. **Copy the structure** from an existing file (such as `en.json`).
3. **Translate each key**. Do not change the key names—only the values.
4. **Test your translation** by switching your Obsidian language setting.

## Contributing Translations

- Submit a pull request with your new or updated translation file.
- Ensure all keys are present and translated.
- If you add new features or UI elements, update the English file first and notify maintainers to propagate changes.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep translations concise and clear.
- Use placeholders (e.g., `{{date}}`) for dynamic values.
- Avoid hardcoding language in code—always use translation keys.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If a string appears in English, check for missing keys in your language file.
- For issues, open a GitHub issue or ask in the plugin community.
