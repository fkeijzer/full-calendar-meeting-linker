# What's New in Full Calendar

This page highlights the latest major features and improvements to help you get the most out of the plugin.  
For a detailed version-by-version breakdown, see the [Changelog](changelog.md).

## ✅ CalDAV Two-Way Sync

You asked, we delivered. CalDAV calendars now support full two-way synchronization. Create, modify, and delete events from your private iCloud, Fastmail, or self-hosted CalDAV servers directly within Obsidian.

---

## ✅ CalDAV validation & Google recurrence fixes

CalDAV imports now verify that the URL is a real calendar collection via PROPFIND, with clearer errors when a non-calendar endpoint is pasted. Google Calendar recurring events respect their source timezone, hide deleted instances reliably, and the mobile OAuth flow opens a safe placeholder tab to avoid popup blockers.

---

## 🌐 Multi-Language Support

Full Calendar now supports multiple languages! The UI will automatically switch based on your Obsidian language setting. Developers can contribute new translations using the i18n system with type-safe keys. See [i18n documentation](features/i18n.md).

---

## ✅ Tasks Integration Reimagined

The integration with the **Obsidian Tasks plugin** has been completely overhauled for maximum performance and reliability. It's now faster, safer, and more intuitive than ever.

- **Live Sync with Tasks Cache:** No more slow vault scans. The calendar now syncs directly with the Tasks plugin's live cache for instant updates.
- **Surgical Edits:** Modifying a task (e.g., scheduling or completing it) no longer rewrites the entire line. The plugin surgically updates only the necessary parts, preserving your custom metadata like links, tags, and comments.
- **Robust Drag-and-Drop:** Drag tasks from the backlog or between dates with confidence. The new provider ensures that scheduling is reliable and predictable.
- **Seamless Experience:** Create, update, and complete tasks directly from the calendar. All changes are powered by the Tasks plugin's own engine for data integrity.

## 🔔 Event Reminder System

Never miss an important meeting again! The new **Event Reminder System** brings native desktop notifications to Full Calendar. Get notified 10 minutes before your events start, and optionally before they end.

- **Smart Notifications:** Native desktop notifications work across all operating systems
- **Flexible Timing:** 10-minute advance warning with optional end-time reminders
- **Universal Support:** Works with all calendar sources - local notes, Google Calendar, CalDAV, and ICS feeds
- **Privacy-First:** All reminder processing happens locally in your vault

➡️ Enable notifications in Settings → General → Event Notifications

## 🧩 Calendar Workspaces

Create and switch between tailored calendar setups with Workspaces. Save your selected sources, filters (categories, tasks, all‑day), and view preferences (month/week/day/timeline) into named workspaces like "Planning" or "Deep Work" and swap in a click. Optimized to apply changes incrementally for fast transitions.

- Save sources, filters, and display preferences per workspace
- Quick switcher in the calendar header and command palette support
- Optional default workspace on startup

➡️ See how to use it: [Workspaces](views/workspaces.md)

## 🏷️ Timeline View for Categories & Projects

Visualize your schedule by category and sub-category with the new **Timeline View**! This advanced view organizes events into horizontal lanes, making it perfect for project management, resource planning, and complex schedules.

- **Hierarchical Lanes:** Events are grouped by category and sub-category, with expandable/collapsible groups.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Move events between lanes to change their category or sub-category instantly.

## 🎨 Powerful Advanced Categories & Coloring

Supercharge your calendar's organization with Advanced Categories! This new system allows you to override a calendar's default color for specific events based on a category prefix in the event's title. It's the foundation for many powerful features to come.

- **Universal Organization:** Works for local and remote calendars. An event from Google Calendar titled `Work - Project Deadline` will be colored correctly in Obsidian.
- **Sub-Categories:** Organize even further with a `Category - SubCategory - Title` format.
- **Smart Setup:** When you enable the feature, the plugin can automatically categorize your existing events based on their folder structure.
- **Autocomplete Editor:** The event editor now has a dedicated "Category" field with autocomplete suggestions for all your existing categories, ensuring consistency.

## ✨ Recurring Events Reimagined

The entire recurring event system has been rebuilt from the ground up to be more powerful, intuitive, and safe.

- **Per-Instance Editing:** Drag, resize, or rename a single occurrence of a recurring event without affecting the entire series. The plugin automatically creates a smart "override" that is linked to the parent.
- **Recurring Tasks That Work:** Check off a single instance of a recurring task as "done." It will be crossed out for that day only, leaving future occurrences ready for action.
- **Safe Deletion:** When deleting a recurring event, you'll now be asked whether you want to delete just that one instance, or the entire series (including any overrides you've made).

- **Proactive Insights Engine:** Automatically analyzes your calendar history and highlights trends, habits, and summaries.
- **Interactive Charting:** Explore your data visually with pie, sunburst, time-series, and activity pattern charts.
- **Persona & Group Analysis:** Create custom insight groups (e.g., "Productivity", "Routine") for tailored analysis.

## 🌍 Robust Timezone Support

Travel and collaborate across timezones with confidence. Full Calendar is now fully timezone-aware, ensuring your events always appear at the correct local time, no matter where you are.

- **Display Timezone:** Set a specific timezone for your calendar view, independent of your system's timezone. Perfect for planning trips or coordinating with remote teams.
- **Automatic Conversion:** Events from all sources—local notes, daily notes, and remote calendars like Google Calendar—are automatically converted to your chosen display timezone.
- **DST Safe:** All conversions are Daylight Saving Time aware, so you never have to worry about "fall back" or "spring forward" bugs again.
