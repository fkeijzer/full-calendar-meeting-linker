# Hover Preview & Context Menu

Interact with events quickly without leaving the calendar view using hover previews and the right-click context menu.

## Hover for Event Details

Using the core **Page Preview** plugin, you can hold `Ctrl`/`Cmd` and hover over any local event (from a Full Note or Daily Note calendar) to see a preview of the note's content.

This is a great way to quickly see meeting notes, agendas, or other context you've added to an event's note.

You can disable the `Ctrl`/`Cmd` key requirement in the "Page Preview" core plugin settings.

## Right-Click Context Menu

Right-click on any event to open a context menu with quick actions.

For local, editable events, you can:

- **Turn into task / Remove checkbox:** Quickly toggle an event's task status.
- **Go to note:** Jump directly to the event's source note, opening it in a **new tab**.
- **Delete:** Delete the event without opening the editor.
