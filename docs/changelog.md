### New Features

- **Full CalDAV Two-Way Sync** (#205)  
  _CalDAV calendars are no longer read-only! You can now create, edit, and delete events directly in Obsidian, and changes will sync back to your CalDAV server._

- **Mobile Workspace Support** (#203)  
  _Workspaces are now fully accessible on mobile!_
  - Added workspace button to footer toolbar on mobile/narrow views.
  - Improved menu handling and truncated labels for better fit.
  - Renamed button from `WS ▾` to `Workspace ▾` for clarity.

- **Mobile Monthly View** (#201)  
  _You can now access the monthly view on mobile devices via the view dropdown or workspace settings._

- **Rich Read-Only Modal** (#205)  
  _The event details modal for read-only events has been upgraded to show rich information including descriptions, attendees, and more, matching the editing experience._

### Improvements & Fixes

- **ICS Parsing & Date Validation** (#199, #203)  
  _Major hardening of the ICS parser for better compatibility and stability:_
  - **Timezones:** Map Windows timezones (e.g., `W. Europe Standard Time`) to IANA identifiers, fixing issues with Outlook/Exchange calendars falling back to UTC.
  - **Date Handling:** Convert `YYYYMMDD` dates to ISO format, validated skip dates in recurring events, and handled all-day events more robustly.
  - **Validation:** Added defensive checks to prevent `RangeError: Invalid time value` crashes and improved error logging.

- **Google Calendar Settings** (#204)  
  _Fixed an issue where the Google Calendar settings menu for credentials was not displaying correctly._

- **Title Parsing** (#203)  
  _Fixed category parsing to prevent false positives (e.g., "anything - Red Hat One") and now shows the full title when no category is defined._

- **Other Fixes**
  - Scheduler license key is now only included when the resource-timeline plugin is loaded.
  - Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` standards.

---

## Version 0.12.5

- **CalDAV validation and parsing** (#193)  
  _CalDAVProvider now validates calendar collections with PROPFIND, parses calendar-data via DOMParser, adds JSDOM-backed tests, and surfaces clearer errors when a URL is not a calendar collection._

- **Provider initialization and cache refresh** (#173)  
  _Providers call initialize() after construction, load events into the cache with completion callbacks, adjust load priorities, and resync event sources without a full calendar rebuild._

- **Google auth and recurring timezone handling** (#191, #190, #94)  
  _Mobile OAuth opens windows synchronously to avoid popup blockers; recurring Google events now honor exdates and BYDAY across timezones, correctly hiding deleted instances and preserving durations across DST._

- **ChronoAnalyser data integrity and Bases provider**  
  _ChronoAnalyser pulls from the main EventStore with corrected category/project parsing, and you can now add an Obsidian Bases calendar (with a guard to enable the Bases plugin first)._

---

## Version 0.12.4

- **CalDAV and Provider Architecture Refactor** (#cc01102)  
  _The calendar source/provider system has been refactored for modularity, reliability, and easier extension. CalDAV support is now more robust and easier to configure._

- **Multi-Language (i18n) Support**  
  _Full Calendar now supports multiple languages. The UI will automatically switch based on your Obsidian language setting. Developers can add new translations via the i18n system with type-safe keys._

- **Provider Registry and Error Handling**  
  _Provider registry logic has been improved for better calendar source management and error handling. Adding new calendar types is now simpler and safer._

- **Documentation and Translation Files**  
  _Updated documentation and added instructions for contributing new translations. See [i18n documentation](features/i18n.md)._

---

## Version 0.12.3.1-beta

- **Tasks Provider Rearchitected for Performance and Precision** (#151, #155)  
  _The Tasks provider is now powered by the official Tasks plugin's live cache, eliminating manual vault scans and delivering instant updates. Edits are now "surgical," preserving user metadata like links, tags, and comments when scheduling or completing tasks._

- **Robust and Stable Settings UI** (#141)  
  _The settings panel has been refactored for stability. The color picker no longer loses focus on changes, and a new `CalendarSettingRow` component ensures a consistent and reliable layout for all calendar sources._

- **Provider-Specific Task Completion** (#143, #144)  
  _The `toggleComplete` logic is now abstracted, allowing calendar providers to implement their own custom behavior for completing tasks._

- **ICS Timezone Fallback** (#91)  
  _Remote ICS calendars with unrecognized timezones will now safely fall back to UTC instead of failing to load._

---

## Version 0.12.3

- **Deep Tasks Integration with Backlog & Filtering** (#122, #128, #136)  
  _Full Calendar now has first-class support for the Obsidian Tasks plugin. A new "Tasks" calendar source syncs your tasks directly onto the calendar. Features include a dedicated task backlog, drag-and-drop rescheduling, and in-calendar completion. Create, update, and delete tasks without leaving the calendar view._

- **Advanced Date Navigation** (#106)  
  _Navigate your calendar with precision using the new "Go To" dropdown in the toolbar. It features a reusable `DatePicker` and context-aware navigation. Right-click on the calendar to jump to a specific month, week, or day._

- **Task Management Workflow & Parsing** (#132, #134, #138)  
  _The Tasks integration includes advanced parsing for dated and undated tasks, multi-day event support, and custom status detection. A new setting allows stripping tags from task titles for a cleaner display. The entire parsing logic is covered by a comprehensive test suite for maximum reliability._

- **Performance & Stability**  
  _The plugin now performs surgical updates on file changes instead of full-vault rescans, significantly improving performance in large vaults. Remote calendars now load in a non-blocking, priority-ordered manner, and race conditions during event source removal have been fixed._

- **Provider Architecture**  
  _The provider registry now loads calendars with priority and uses a new `isFileRelevant()` hook for cleaner file-change handling. "Manage calendar" logic has been delegated to the respective providers for better modularity._

- **Notification and Reminder Reliability**  
  _End-time reminders now fire correctly for events that are already in progress, ensuring you never miss the end of an important block of time._

- **Core Component Stability** (#100, #101, #126)  
  _Fixed numerous bugs, including a race condition when removing event sources, an issue preventing the create modal from appearing if no editable calendars exist, and a bug where the Daily Notes calendar would fail without a template. New calendars now appear instantly in settings without a "Provider not found" flash._

---

## Version 0.12.2 (beta)

- **Multi-day Daily Note events with explicit endDate**  
  _Daily Note calendar now supports explicit multi‑day events via `[endDate:: YYYY-MM-DD]` while remaining backward compatible with legacy overnight detection._

- **Central TimeEngine**  
  _Single timer maintains a sorted time-sensitive cache and publishes a `time-tick` event consumed by status bar, notifications, and other listeners._

- **Status Bar current/upcoming events**  
  _Lightweight status bar UI subscribes to `TimeEngine` to surface what's happening now and next._

- **Interactive time‑axis zoom** (#96)  
  _Ctrl/Cmd + scroll to dynamically zoom the vertical (timeGrid) or horizontal (resourceTimeline) axis for fast focus changes._

- **Advanced recurrence intervals & positional monthly rules** (#97)  
  _Support for interval-based repeats (e.g., every 2 weeks) and positional monthly rules (2nd Tuesday, last Friday) with iCal import/export parity._

- **Codebase compliance & safety**  
  _Replaced loose `any` casts, moved inline styles to CSS, added `instanceof` guards for file/folder objects, removed custom leaf detaching on unload._

- **Reactive calendar view lifecycle**  
  _`view-config-changed` now triggers targeted cache repopulation and a new `resync` event prompts precise re-renders for snappier UI updates._

- **NotificationManager refactor**  
  _No internal timer; now a passive subscriber to `TimeEngine`, reducing duplicate intervals and simplifying lifecycle management._

- **Robust timezone conversion for cross-day events**  
  _`convertEvent` rewritten as a pure function; correctly handles explicit `endDate` and legacy overnight semantics with stricter type guards._

---

## Version 0.12.1 (beta)

- **Event Reminder System with Desktop Notifications (BETA)**  
  _Introducing the `NotificationManager` for native desktop notifications. Users can opt-in to receive reminders 10 minutes before events start and, optionally, 10 minutes before they end. Perfect for never missing important meetings or deadlines._

- **Multi-Account Google Calendar Integration**  
  _Google Calendar integration now supports connecting and managing multiple accounts simultaneously. Features a dedicated account management hub with a streamlined two-step wizard for adding new calendars from any connected account._

- **Provider-Based Architecture with Multi-Account Support**  
  _Complete architectural overhaul to a provider-based system where each calendar source (Local, Daily Notes, ICS, CalDAV, Google) is a self-contained, instanced provider. The new `ProviderRegistry` acts as a central persistence gateway, managing all I/O and abstracting storage details. This enables stateful features and robust multi-account Google Calendar integration._

- **Event-Driven Settings with Instant Updates**  
  _Settings persistence refactored to a publish/subscribe model. The `saveSettings` function now diffs old vs new state and publishes granular events (`sources-changed`, `view-config-changed`, `settings-updated`). Calendar views re-render instantly without flicker or unnecessary reloads._

- **Lazy-Loading for Faster Startup Performance**  
  _Heavy dependencies are now dynamically imported only when needed: FullCalendar engine loads when opening a calendar view, React modals load on demand. This dramatically reduces startup time and memory usage._

- **Centralized Event Enhancement Pipeline**  
  _New `EventEnhancer` module centralizes all timezone conversions and category parsing, essentially intercepting all raw events befor it reaches the Cache. Business logic extracted into dedicated stateless modules with a new `WorkspaceManager` handling all workspace filtering and display logic._

- **Timezone Handling for Recurring Events** [#94](https://github.com/YouFoundJK/plugin-full-calendar/issues/94)  
  _Recurring events now properly handle timezones with endDate support, resolving timezone branching issues and ensuring correct time display across different time zones._

- **ICS events now loads properly** [#91](https://github.com/YouFoundJK/plugin-full-calendar/issues/91)  
  _Parsing issues in Remote ICS calendar is fixed and should now load properly._

---

## Version 0.11.9

- **Calendar Workspaces** (#90)  
  _Save and switch between customized calendar setups (sources, filters, and view preferences). Workspaces include a header switcher, a command palette action ("Full Calendar: Switch Workspace"), and an optional default workspace on startup. Saved state covers selected sources (Local, Daily Notes, ICS, CalDAV, Google), category/sub‑category filters, tasks visibility, all‑day toggle, initial view (month/week/day/timeline), week start, and time‑grid display options._

- **Faster Switching and Rendering**  
  _Workspace application is incremental (sources → filters → view) to avoid full calendar rebuilds. Switching preserves context where possible (e.g., scroll/selection) and significantly improves responsiveness on large vaults._

- **Workspace Management UX**  
  _Add Save as Workspace, Rename, Delete in the calendar header menu; set a Default Workspace in Settings; and assign hotkeys through Obsidian’s Hotkeys for one‑press switching._

- **Edit Modal Sub‑category Parsing**  
  _Fixes a regression where sub‑categories could disappear when editing the title in the modal. The title parser now consistently preserves the `Category - SubCategory - Title` format on save._

- **Workspace Persistence Edge Cases**  
  _Improved robustness when loading a workspace that references a removed or renamed source. Adds safe fallbacks to an "All Events" view and clearer status messaging._

---

## Version 0.11.8

- **Business Hours and Background Events Support**  
  _Highlight working hours in calendar views and display events as background highlights (e.g., vacations or focus blocks). Configurable via settings and event frontmatter._

- **Timeline View Category Shadow Events** (#76)  
  _Adds optional display of category shadow events in Timeline View for better visual context and planning._

- **Real-Time Duplicate Event Validation** (#67)  
  _Prevents creation of duplicate events in the calendar interface, improving scheduling accuracy._

- **Edit Modal Now Supports Subcategory Editing**  
  _The "Edit Event" modal now parses and displays sub-categories directly in the event title. Users can edit them inline and changes are preserved._

- **Settings Modal Reorganization and Footer**  
  _UI updates include reorganized settings for better clarity, hover hints for display options, and a new footer for versioning and help links._

- **Configuration Migration for Legacy Support**  
  _Legacy settings like `subprojectKeywords_exclude` are migrated automatically, and missing fields (e.g., `persona`) are filled safely._

- **Type Safety and Safer DOM Manipulations** (#69, #71)  
  _Removed unsafe type assertions across key modules (`DailyNoteCalendar`, `GoogleCalendar`, `interop`) and introduced robust DOM update utilities (`safeCreateEl`, `safeEmpty`)._

- **Recurring Task Completion Preserves Child Timing** (#75)  
  _Undoing completed recurring tasks now correctly retains the timing of override events. Adds full test coverage for various edge cases._

- **All-Day Events Treated as Floating in RRULE**  
  _All-day recurring events now behave correctly as floating events, fixing unintended start time offsets._

- **Coverage for Business Hours, Background Events, and Override Logic**  
  _New test suites validate schema correctness, UI rendering, and recurring timing behavior._

---

## Version 0.11.7

- **Full Google Calendar Integration with Two‑Way Sync**  
  _Connect your Google account to create, modify, and delete events (including recurring events) directly in Obsidian. Includes OAuth 2.0 authentication, calendar selection, and proper token refresh handling._

- **Centralized and Reusable Form Components**  
  _Inputs like URL, Username, Password, Directory Select, and Heading have been refactored into dual‑mode primitives with a `readOnly` mode for consistent display. A generic `TextInput` replaces one‑off components._

- **Modularized Settings Tab and Changelog Component**  
  _Settings sections are now organized into dedicated renderers with improved type safety. A new `Changelog.tsx` component has been added for clearer update visibility._

- **Unified Event Parsing Pipeline**  
  _Calendar parsers now output raw events without settings dependencies and pass them through a single `enhanceEvent` function for category logic. Tests have been updated to separately verify raw parsing and enhancement._

- **Modular Event Cache Management**  
  _The `EventCache` logic is split into dedicated modules (`RemoteCacheUpdater`, `LocalCacheUpdater`, `IdentifierManager`, `RecurringEventManager`), making synchronization and recurring event handling more reliable._

- **Daily Note Calendar Parsing and Cache Update Logic**  
  _Parsing bugs in `DailyNoteCalendar` have been fixed, and `modifyEvent` now correctly flags dirty events to ensure the UI updates when frontmatter changes (e.g., `skipDate`)._

- **Codebase Refactor for Type Safety and Maintainability**  
  _Shared types and utilities have been centralized, internal names clarified, and redundant code removed—all without changing user‑facing behavior._

---

## Version 0.11.6

- **Advanced Categorization with Hierarchical Timeline View**  
  _Events can now be organized by categories and sub-categories in a new Resource Timeline view. Expandable groups and aggregated parent rows make it easier to manage complex schedules._

  _Change an event’s category or sub-category directly from the timeline view by dragging it to a different lane. Titles and metadata update automatically._

- **Cleaner UI and Initial View Options**  
  _The event modal and settings UI have been polished with dropdown options and a new initial view setting that supports the timeline view._

- **Smarter Event Titles and Filenames**  
  _Events now display clearer titles (e.g., `SubCategory - Event Name`) while keeping filenames and internal data consistent._

- **Multi-Level Category Parsing**  
  _Parsing of event titles with multiple category levels (e.g., `Category - SubCategory - Title`) has been fixed, ensuring correct category and sub-category assignment._

- **License Update**  
  _The plugin license has been updated to GPLv3 to comply with FullCalendar requirements._

---

## Version 0.11.5-beta

- **Monthly and Yearly Recurring Events**  
  _You can now create events that repeat every month or every year — perfect for things like anniversaries, billing cycles, or project reviews._

- **Smarter "Repeats" Menu in Event Modal**  
  _The old "Recurring" checkbox is gone. Instead, use a new dropdown to choose from Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly recurrence. The UI updates dynamically to match your selection._

- **Human-Friendly Filenames for Recurring Notes**  
  _Recurring event notes now get cleaner, more descriptive names like `(Every year on July 30th) My Event.md`._

- **Enhanced Timezone and All-Day Support**  
  _Timezone handling for recurring events is now more accurate, and All-Day events display correctly across time boundaries._

- **Right-Click Task Toggle for Recurring Tasks**  
  _Recurring tasks can now be marked as complete using the right-click menu, just like one-off tasks._

- **Safer Rendering and UI Cleanups**  
  _Removed use of unsafe HTML injection in the UI. Improved event rendering, loading states, and general UI responsiveness._

## Version 0.11.4

- **Smarter Recurring Events and Tasks**  
  _Recurring events can now be edited per-instance — drag, resize, or complete a task without affecting the whole series. Changes are reversible and tracked cleanly._

- **Safe Deletion with Confirmation Options**  
  _Deleting a recurring event now asks whether to remove just one instance, the entire series, or promote existing edits to standalone events._

- **Better Task Behavior for Repeating Events**  
  _Recurring tasks now behave just like regular ones — you can check them off individually, and they show up correctly in the calendar._

- **Multi-day all-day events fix by @yalikebaz**  
  _Multi-day all-day events made inclusive for local calendars. Thanks to @yalikebaz for the fix!_
